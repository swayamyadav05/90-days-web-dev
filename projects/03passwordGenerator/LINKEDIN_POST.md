🔐 **Just Built: Advanced Password Generator with Security Intelligence!**

Excited to share my latest React project - a modern password generator that goes beyond basic character randomization!

**🚀 Key Features:**
✅ Real-time password strength analysis using zxcvbn
✅ Breach detection via HaveIBeenPwned API
✅ Customizable length (6-32 chars) with smart recommendations
✅ Beautiful responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
✅ Privacy-first approach - everything runs locally

**🛡️ Security Highlights:**
• Uses k-anonymity model for breach checking
• SHA-1 hashing for API security
• No password storage or tracking
• Cryptographically secure random generation

**🎨 Tech Stack:**
• React 19 with modern hooks
• Vite for lightning-fast development
• Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
• crypto-js for security utilities

**🔒 Why This Matters:**
With 81% of data breaches caused by weak passwords, tools like this help developers and users create truly secure credentials. The breach detection feature is particularly valuable - it checks against 11+ billion compromised passwords!

**💡 Learning Highlights:**
• Implementing secure crypto functions in the browser
• Working with external security APIs
• Creating intuitive UX for complex security features
• Balancing security with usability

Perfect for developers, security-conscious users, or anyone who wants to level up their password game!
